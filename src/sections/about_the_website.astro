      good question. the website is built using <a
        href="https://astro.build/"
        target="_blank"
        title="Astro"
        class="bg-orange-400 text-base-text px-1">Astro</a
      >, a front-end framework to built blazing fast static websites. the design
      is recreated from scratch and has been heavily inspired from <span
        class="italic">Astro Theme Cody</span
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      the repository is available <a
        href={REPO_LINK}
        target="_blank"
        title="Repoistory Link"
        class="bg-base-highlight text-base-text px-1">here</a
      >. i've tried my best to keep it easily editable and reusable. have a good
      time!
